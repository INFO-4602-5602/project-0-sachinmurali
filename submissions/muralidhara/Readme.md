Completed Whistles:

1. Transitions - A menu has been added to select a dataset and view the plot. 

2. Replication - All the graphs have been replicated using Microsoft Excel. The main difference in assembling the visualizations through Excel was with respect to the time and the number of steps taken. I was able to generate the graphs in a few minutes. However, with that being said, we can only go a certain distance with Excel. All the images are placed in the image folder.
